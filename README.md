# Motivation behind MD5Dumper
MD5Dumper aims to automatise file system synchronization between distinct ends. Intended specially for auto-patch servers.

Due to the way auto-patch servers interact with clients, data traffic on each check is really important to optimize. MD5Dumper attempts to minimize the size of data interchanged between those checks.
