# Features of MD5Dumper
MD5Dumper is a tool that:
- Can generate a canonical representation of every file under a directory. (the Fsmap format)
- Can minify Fsmap representations to reduce interchanged data size.
- Can summarize Fsmap to reduce interchanged data size for initial checksum.
- Compare minified Fsmap and local directory Fsmap, and detect missing/corrupted/extra files

# Motivation behind MD5Dumper
MD5Dumper aims to automatise file system synchronization between distinct ends. Intended specially for auto-patch servers.

Due to the way auto-patch servers interact with clients, data traffic on each check is really important to optimize. MD5Dumper attempts to minimize the size of data interchanged between those checks.

# Anatomy of a Fsmap
An Fsmap is a canonical representation of a directory. It is generated by recursively traversing a directory in a sorted way and creating MD5 hashes of every file's content + file's relative path.
```typescript
declare type Fsmap = FsmapEntry[];

declare type FsmapEntry = {
  index: number; // Index to ensure traverse order
  path?: string; // Relative file system path
  md5: string; // h(relativePath + content)
};
```
